The following project is based on a donut cafe in the peaceful streets of Osaka, Japan. The usermight be able to select our secret and tasty dough as well as choose between one of the topping elections available for spring season, they can choose between sakura or peach icing. 

Through OOP JS (Object Oriented Programming) my college and I were able to develop this engaging donut spot where custom classes and instantiate objects were cutomized. This project is responsive from mobile to desktop.

Having in mind that this is a big project, we use parcel.js with the main purpuse of minify and make efficient the code.
